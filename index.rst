Welcome to FinAILab! - Democratizing AI and Machine Learning in Finance
===========================================================

Welcome to the Documentation for `FinAILab <http://finailab.com/>`_. This documentation contains the information about using FinAILab for building machine learning models and concepts of Machine Learning customized to Finance.

Key highlights of Fin AI Lab
--------------------------------------
- Cloud based python platform with ready to use algorithms, code and data
- ML and AI Algorithm customised to finance - refrain from infinite google search getting lost in the overwhelming machine learning.
- Plug and play master template across several ML types - just plug in the data and build models.
- Historical Prices for thousands of asset classes, macroeconomic data, fundamentals and alternative data - refer to detailed database documentation
- Curated projects in Machine Learning in Finance across all application of Finance and Machine Learning types - refer to projects
