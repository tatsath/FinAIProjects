FinAILab-Templates - A curated repository of machine learning and AI templates across Machine learning type and Financial Application type.
===========================================================

Just copy templates or copy code, plug in the data and build models.

For more details refer to the book `Blueprints of Machine Learning and Data Science in Finance <https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Science-Blueprints-Finance/dp/1492073059>`_.
